============

For Clio

1) Near-real-time AJAX status refresh feature done - Statuses update every 3 seconds.

2) Putting users into teams feature done - Used polymorphic association; users pick their teams at sign-up.

3) All integration tests done using Capybara (spec/requests/index_page_spec.rb). Coverage include testing the above two features (requires PhantomJS on system) and user sign in, sign up, and sign out.
